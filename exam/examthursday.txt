When done please email your exam to
rbunker@lisco.com

Please put your answers between the [[ ]] delimiters. For example
[[ blah
blah
blah
]]

This will allow me split the tests into separate files that contain the answers to the same question.
For example there will be a file called answer1.txt which contains all the answers given to the
first question.

Also please only write between the [[ ]] because I will need the question numbers to put the exams back together.

1. Consider this dynamic creation of an object.
   var obj = new Object();
   obj.a = 5
   obj.b = obj.a;
   obj.c = {};
   obj.c.a = 10;
   obj.d = [];
   obj.d.push(5)
   obj.d.push(10);
   
Rewrite this as a single literal expression
   var obj = {
    ---
   }
[[ var obj = {
      a:5,
      b:a,
     c:{ a : 10},
     d: [5, 10]
} ]]  

2. (Introduction.2)
JavaScript is a loosely-typed language. Give an example using a function that demonstrates this.
[[var foo = function(){
					console.log("hello world");
				};
				if(foo.constructor() != String){
					foo = "1";
					console.log("1");
				}]] 

3. (Introduction.3) 
What happens if you concatenate 1 to an array object?
[[ 
       
       var arr1 = [9,10,11, 12];
				result = arr1.toString();
				result =result +5;
				console.log(result);
        
        converts array to string and concatenates any integer, e.g
        if arr1 = [9,10,11, 12] then arr1 + 5 will be:
       9,10,11, 125]  
       ]

4. (Introduction.4) 
// Here is a definition of an object using an anonymous self-invoking function
var obj1 = (function () {
		var a;
		a = 5;
		return {
			foo: function(){console.log(a)}
		}
	})();  //   anonymous self-invoking function

// Here is a definition of an object using a constructor function	
    function Foo() {
	   this.a = 5;
    }
    Foo.prototype.foo = function(){console.log(this.a)}	
    var obj2 = new Foo();
    
Look at obj1 and obj2 in the Watch window. You will notice that the value of a is accessible in obj2
but not in obj1. Why?
[[
It is due to the fact that obj1 is using self invoking function which has closure and it intializes 'a' and use 'a'.
But while creating obj2 we use new keyword and thus it inherits all the property of Foo which has 'a'.
]]	

5. (Introduction.5) 
var obj = (function() {
	var i, f;
	f = [];
	for (i=0; i<3; i++) {
		f.push(function() {console.log(i)});
	}
	
	return f;	
})();

obj[0]()  writes 3 to console
obj[1]()  writes 3 to console
obj[2]()  writes 3 to console

This occurs because i is in the closure of each function created.

Fix this problem so that function obj[n] writes n to the console.
[[   
var obj = (function() {
        var i, f;
        f = [];
        for (i=0; i<3; i++) {
            (function(m) {
                f.push(function () {
                    console.log(m);
                })
            })(i);
        }

        return f;
    })();
 ]]	

6. (Introduction.6)
Put a breakpoint at line 706 of jquery-1.0.js and step into f. 
Why does i have the value that is shown in the Watch window? (Note: the
value depends on the selector used in your code that caused the breakpoint to be hit so I can't
say what it will be in your case)
[[ Put your answer here. ]]	

7. (Introduction.7) 
Why is the use of global variables discouraged?
[[ because javascript share single global namespace and thus if we use global namespace then it will pollute global namespace
 and sometimese there might be collision  ]]	

8. (Introduction.8)
foo.call({a:5, b:6}, [10, 15]);
Write a function foo that will write its context and its parameters to the console when it is called this way.
You decide on the format used by console.log().
[[ function foo(n1) {
      			console.log("" + this.a + ", " + this.b + ", " + n1[0]+ ", " + n1[1]);
   				 } ]]

9. (Introduction.9) 
Why does 0==false evaluate to true but 0===false evaluate to false
[[ 
Because == does the typecasting but === doesnot do the typecasting
 ]]

10. (Introduction.10)
What will be the result of running the following code. Please explain why the error occurred.
  function doMath() {
    var f = new Foo(10);
    f.add(10).multiply(2).display();
  }
	
  function Foo(value) {
    this.value = value;		
  }
	
  Foo.prototype.add = function(n) {
    this.value += n;
    return this;
   }
	
   Foo.prototype.multiply = function(n) {
     this.value *= n;
   }
	
   Foo.prototype.display = function() {
     alert(this.value);
   }
[[ It is because we are not returning 'this' from multiply and display function so we cant use chaining in this situation. ]]	

11. (Introduction.11)
How many different types of arguments can the jQuery function handle?
In other words if jQuery were written in Java how many overloaded versions of jQuery would be required.
Please briefly describe the different types of arguments. I want more than just a number here.
[[ window, function and objects as string 

]]	

12. (Introduction.12)
Describe one use of the Call stack in the Chrome debugger.
[[
The call stack displays the events during the debugging 
which help us to find the where we are in code and also help to find the erros ]]	

13. (Demo.1)
The code at lines 256-260 of jquery-1.0.js can be simplified. Please do so.
[[Put your answer here]]	

14. (Demo.2)
Does document.getElementsByClassName() return a live node list? Write some code to support your answer and
include it below.
[[	   div = $("#log1");
				divs = document.getElementsByClassName("abc");
				          
				div1 = $("<div class=\"cde\">");
				div.append(divs);
				div1.html("Hello");
				 console.log(divs.length);    ]]	

15. (Demo.3)
console.log(foobar.privateFunction) returns undefined. Why?
[[ Because foobar has no privateFunction but only a propert a having value 10]]	

16. (Demo.4)
In demojQuery.html, jQuery serves as both a regular function and a constructor function. Please explain
what I mean by this.
[[ It is due to the fact that if DOM is window then it calls the constructer  ]]

17. (Demo.5)
In mondayTest.html
Line 23 console.log(log1 === log2) returns false. Describe how to modify the program so that 
log1 === log2 returns true.
[[ 
    Foo.prototype.log = function(value){
      console.log(value);
    }; ]]

18. (PhaseI.1)
Which functions are defined at line 296 during the interpretation of jquery-1.0.js
[[ jQuery.macros.each ]]

19. (PhaseI.2)
We discovered that jQuery adds 3 variables to the global name space: "jQuery", "$" and "events".
What is the line number where "events" is added to the global namespace?
Hint: start looking at line 1138
[[  1164 ]]

20. (PhaseI.3)
Line 466 is the definition of the property ":" of the object jQuery.expr.
Use jQuery.extend to add
   nth-child "jQuery.sibling(a,m[3]).cur"
to the ":' property.
Do not modify jquery-1.0.js!
Put your call to jQuery.extend in the space below.
[[ Put your answer here. ]]

21. (PhaseI.4)
In the following code
   var a = ["up", "down", "left", "right"];
   var b = {};

   function myconcat(suffix) {
     b[this] = this + suffix;
   }
			
   jQuery.each(a, myconcat, ["!"]);

a and b are global. Modify the example so that a and b are local variables of some function. Explain 
why the result is the same.
[[ Put your answer here. ]]

22. (PhaseI.5)
Given the following:
function f(...) {...}
jQuery.each(a, f, [5, "hello", 8])
What should the parameters of function f be?
[[ The parameter of the function f can be any.
eg. function (a,b,c){}
or function (a,b){}
or function (){}
Its just that, 
we can only access parameters that are received by the function 
and is passed to the function.]]

23. (PhaseI.6)
Rewrite the following code so that jQuery is not used at all.
var ps = document.querySelectorAll(".foo");
function setBackground(i, el) {
   el.style.backgroundColor="red";
}
jQuery.each(ps, setBackground);   <-- don't use each

[[
Put your answer here.
//$('.foo').style.backgroundColor="red"; ]]

24. (PhaseI.7)
Use jQuery.extend to add a toString method to to {a:5, b:"hello"}
[[ var obj = {a:5,b:"hello"};
				function toString1() {
					console.log("a: " + this.a + ", b:" + this.b)
				}
				jQuery.extend(obj, {toString: toString1});	
						obj.toString();	 ]]

25. (PhaseI.8)
Explain what the code at line 949 of modernizr.js does.
[[          // run the test, throw the return value into the Modernizr,
            //   then based on that boolean, define an appropriate className
            //   and push it into an array of classes we'll join later. 
            The mordenizer array value is assigned in line 949 with the array tests
           in foreach loop
            ]]

26. (PhaseI.9)
Modify the merge algorithm so that it doesn't remove duplicates. 
How can you test your code without modifying jquery-1.0.js ?
[ var obj = {};
  function merge(first, second) {
        var i = first.length,
        j = 0;

        if ( typeof second.length === "number" ) {
          for ( var l = second.length; j < l; j++ ) {
            first[ i++ ] = second[ j ];
          }

        } else {
          while ( second[j] !== undefined ) {
            first[ i++ ] = second[ j++ ];
          }
        }

        first.length = i;

        return first;
  }
  jQuery.extend({merge: merge});]

27. (PhaseI.10)
Here is function jQuery.merge in jquery-1.1.3a.js.
function merge (first, second) {
		for ( var i = 0; second[i]; i++ )
			first.push(second[i]);
		return first;
	}
	
var result = merge([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 0, 8 ])	
result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Why?
What does this say about the expected contents of the array second?

[[ 
The loop gets terminated when it second[i] has value 0 at index 0 
because jquery expects DOM elements not to be integer.  So, we are getting value
up to the 2nd index of second.
]]
	
28. (PhaseI.11) 
The version of jQuery.map in jquery-1.2.2b.js is as follows:
map: function ( elems, callback ) {
  var ret = [];

  // Go through the array, translating each of the items to their
  // new value (or values).
  for ( var i = 0, length = elems.length; i < length; i++ ) {
    var value = callback( elems[ i ], i );

    if ( value !== null && value != undefined ) {
      if ( value.constructor != Array ) 
        value = [ value ]; 

        ret = ret.concat( value ); 
      }
    }

    return ret; //modified in jquery-1.2.5.js
  }

Give an example of a call to jQuery.map that will work in jquery-1.0, but will not work in jquery-1.2.2b
[[ var a = [10,20,30,40];
  result = jQuery.map(a, "a-10"); ]]

29 (Phase1.12)
Explain why line 801 is necessary.
801	if ( val.constructor != Array ) val = [val];
[[ Put your answer here ]]

30. (Phase1.13)
Can the first parameter jQuery.grep be an Object instead of an Array? Explain your answer. I want
more than just a yes or no here.
[[ No. It uses 
for ( var i = 0; i < elems.length; i++ ) 
instead of 
for (var i in elems) ]]

31. (Phase1.14)
What property does pushStack add to its context? What is its value?
[[  stack which is an array of arrays. 
Each array is the DOM elements in the jQuery object
when pushStack was called.  a is added to the pushstack context and its value changes to [2,3,4,5]]]

32. (Phase1.15) Regular expressions used in jQuery
The regular expression 
/^([#.]?)([a-z0-9\\*_-]*)/
will match any string. Why?
[[ because 
[#.]?  match single character  between zero and one time, as many times as possible, giving back as needed
[a-z0-9\\*_-]* match a single character between zero and unlimited times, as many times as possible, giving back as needed
 ]]

33. (Phase1.16) jQuery.className.has
Is jQuery.className.has case sensitive or not? Please justify your answer. I want more than a yes or no here.
[[ Yes it is case sensitive. Because it is checking the by the name ]]

34. (Phase1.17)
If you attempt to add a class that an element already has will it be added again. Please justify your answer
I want more than a yes or no here.
[[ Because although it is checking that element has already class of not but it is not finding it.
 Because it is using regular expression which is not finding it. ]]

35. (Phase1.18) jQuery.className.remove
Is 
	var re = new RegExp("(^|\\s*\\b[^-])"+c+"($|\\b(?=[^-]))", "g");
	o.className.replace(re, "");
equivalent to 
	var re = /(^|\\s*\\b[^-])"+c+"($|\\b(?=[^-]))/g;
	o.className.replace(re, "");

Please justify your answer. I want more than a yes or no here.

36. (Phase1.19)
Create some HTML so that getAll appears three times on the Call Stack
[[ function foo() {foobar()}
function foobar() {debugger; console.log("in foobar")}
foo();	 ]]

37. (Phase1.20)
Which do you think is faster, jQuery.trim() or the trim method of String? I will accept either
if your answer is convincing.
[[ trim of jquery use regular expression so it should be faster than native method of string 
and also regular expression in cached by some browser]]

38. (Phase1.21)
Line 712: return { r: r, t: t }
This is what is returned by filter. Please describe what r and t are. 
In particular can r be [ ] and is t always the empty string?
[[r is array of filtered elements and t is modified expression string
Yes, when there is no matched elements.
